### ⚙️ **Technical Optimizations**

**Speed:**
- ✅ 12 parallel workers (up from 10)
- ✅ Optimized delays: 0.08-0.2 sec (faster)
- ✅ 30 queries per round (up from 20)
- ✅ Faster page transitions: 0.15-0.4 sec

**Uniqueness:**
- ✅ Random starting pages (1-10) for each query
- ✅ Shuffled query order every round
- ✅ Hash-based deduplication (text_hash column)
- ✅ Up to 30 pages deep per query
- ✅ Stops after 3 empty pages (efficiency)

**Intelligence:**
- ✅ Auto-skips duplicate cases
- ✅ Handles network timeouts gracefully
- ✅ Balanced depth (30 pages max)
- ✅ Continuous rounds with variety

---

## 🎯 MODE: UNLIMITED

**The collector will:**
- ✓ Run until YOU manually stop it (Ctrl+C)
- ✓ Keep extracting NEW and UNIQUE cases
- ✓ Auto-deduplicate (no duplicates stored)
- ✓ Maintain ~1,000 cases/hour rate
- ✓ Run 24/7 if you let it

**Target:** 100,000 cases (will run indefinitely)

## 📊 HOW TO MONITOR

### **Quick Status** (Run anytime):
```powershell
python quick_status.py
```
Shows:
- Total cases
- Collection rate (last 5 min, 30 min, hour)
- Next milestone & ETA
- Collector status (🟢 ACTIVE / 🔴 STOPPED)

### **Detailed Stats**:
```powershell

## 🛑 HOW TO STOP

When you're ready to stop collection:

**Option 1: Press Ctrl+C** in the collector terminal

**Option 2: Close the terminal** running the collector

**The collector will:**
- ✅ Safely flush all buffered cases to database
- ✅ Show final statistics
- ✅ Report total cases collected

---

## 🎓 WHAT'S NEXT?

### **Option A: Train Model at 5,000 cases** (Recommended)
```powershell
python scripts\pipeline\batch_trainer.py --batch_size 500 --force
```
- Expected accuracy: **70-75%** (up from 60%)
- Training time: ~30 minutes on GPU
- Will use all 5,000 cases for training

### **Option B: Continue to 10,000+ cases**
- Just let the collector keep running!
- Better model with more data
- Train when you reach desired amount

### **Option C: Start Automated Pipeline**
```powershell
python scripts\pipeline\run_5hour_cycle.py
```
- Auto-collect → auto-train → repeat
- Runs for 5 hours continuously

## 🔥 UNIQUENESS GUARANTEE

**How we ensure NEW and UNIQUE cases:**

1. **Hash-based Deduplication:**
   - Every case gets a unique hash (SHA256)
   - Database enforces UNIQUE constraint on text_hash
   - Duplicate cases automatically rejected

2. **161 Different Search Queries:**
   - Covers all major crime types, IPC sections, courts
   - Different legal terms, years, case types
   - Maximum variety = more unique cases

3. **Random Starting Pages (1-10):**
   - Each query starts from random page
   - Different results every round
   - Explores deeper into case archives

4. **Shuffled Query Order:**
   - Queries randomized every round
   - Unpredictable search pattern
   - Maximizes coverage

5. **Deep Search (30 pages):**
   - Goes beyond surface results
   - Finds obscure cases
   - Stops intelligently when no more results

---

## 💡 PRO TIPS

1. **Check progress frequently:**
   ```powershell
   python quick_status.py
   ```

2. **Don't stop until 5,000:**
   - Just 147 cases away!
   - About 10 minutes at current rate

3. **Database location:**
   - Path: `data/legal_cases_10M.db`
   - Current size: ~50 MB
   - Growing automatically

4. **Logs location:**
   - Path: `logs/continuous_5000.log`
   - Real-time collection activity
